# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate level projects I'm building to become job-ready as a Data Analyst and later transition into Data Science and ML roles.  
Each folder represents one focused learning day or project, following a roadmap to build core skills in Python, Pandas, SQL, and real-world datasets.
