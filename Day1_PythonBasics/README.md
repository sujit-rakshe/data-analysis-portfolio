# Day 1 – Python Basics for Data Analysis

This notebook demonstrates simple Python functions used for basic data analysis tasks. It's part of my daily Data Analyst learning journey.

## 📌 Task

Write a Python function that:
- Accepts a list of numbers
- Returns the following statistics:
  - Sum
  - Average
  - Maximum
  - Minimum

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Python function definition
- Using built-in functions: `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`, `len()`
- Inline code comments for clarity
- Basic debugging and testing in Jupyter/Colab

## 📝 Sample Output

```python
list_info([10, 20, 30, 40])

# Output:
# Sum is: 100
# Average is: 25.0
# Max is: 40
# Min is: 10
